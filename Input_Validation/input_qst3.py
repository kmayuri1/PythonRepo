import pyinputplus as pyip
pattern=pyip.inputInt('Enter nbr:')
print(pattern)
pattern1=pyip.inputFloat('Enter nbr:')
print(pattern1)
print('InputInt will return only int value and if trying to give float value its shows error message.whereas inputFloat returns float value and if trying to give int value its took int value to')
